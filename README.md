### Description üìù

An accordion is a UI component that allows content to be expanded or collapsed with a click on the headers. This example demonstrates how to implement an FAQ accordion using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

#### Key Features of an Accordion:

1. **Expandable Sections**: Only one section is displayed at a time, while others remain hidden.
2. **Toggle Mechanism**: Users can click headers to expand or collapse content.
3. **Space Efficiency**: Saves screen space by collapsing unused sections.
4. **Interactive**: Enhances user experience by making navigation through content easier.

Accordions are widely used in FAQs, menus, and content-heavy websites to improve readability and organization.

### Implementation Details

- **State Management**: The app keeps track of which section is expanded using a state hook. The index of the expanded section is stored as `active`. When no sections are expanded, `active` is set to -1.
  ```typescript
  const [active, setActive] = useState<number>(-1);
  ```
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS is used for styling. Given the simplicity of this app, Tailwind CSS is a suitable choice. However, for larger projects, module-based CSS might be more appropriate.
- **TypeScript**: TypeScript ensures type safety, making the code more robust and maintainable. While not necessary for such a small app, it's a good practice for self-improvement.
- **Animations**: Framer Motion is used to create the expand animation, enhancing the visual appeal and user experience.
